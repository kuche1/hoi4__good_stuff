-- 2023.09.16: debug_smooth + optimizations + additional optimizations + cache cleaned:
--      amd ryzen 5600G (using somewhat debloated windows):
--          0.025 good for early game / mid game
--          0.18 too fast for late game (makes micro hard but performance is OK)
--          0.07 is too much for late game (makes game lag)
--
--  2023.09.04: debug_smooth + optimizations + additional optimizations:
--      amd ryzen 5600G (using somewhat debloated windows):
--          0.03 up until 1939
--          0.09 not good enough 1940 (probably because of the significantly lowered LAG_DAYS_FOR_PAUSE)
--              at some point 0.07 1943 is OK and at some point 0.18 1942 is not OK ... WTF

--  2023.09.02: debug_smooth + optimizations:
--      amd ryzen 5600G (using somewhat debloated windows):
--          0.2 - 1944 not always OK
--          0.075 - 1944 not ok

--  2023.08.31: debug_smooth + optimizations:
--      amd ryzen 5600G (using windows):
--          0.065 - can't keep up 1938
--          0.07 - absolutely perfect for up to 1945 (have not ran any tests after that)
--  conclusion:
--      aim for something <=0.07 and >0.065

--  with new mod optimizations + debug_smooth
--      amd ryzen 5 1600
--          0.02 - minor slowdown at 1936 jul while using rustdesk
--          0.03 - no slowdown until at least 1936 mar
--          0.04 - no slowdown until at least 1938 may
--          0.06 - no slowdown until at least 1937 jul
--      amd ryzen 5 5600
--          0.02 - no slowdown until at least 1940

-- shitty laptop:
--     with optimized map v2:
--         MP lag during war   on 0.13
--         MP lag during piece on 0.05
