 nsb_gyrocopter_desc:"The gyrocopter was invented by a Spanish engineer, Juan de la Cierva, and flown on 9 Jan 1923 at Cuatro Veintos Airfiled, Madrid. It was referred to as the autogyro and it resembled a fixed wing aircraft. This was the first rotary aircraft to have flown successfully. A gyrocopter is unlike a helicopter because the rotors are not powered. Lift occurs when air moves across the blades, thus causing the rotor to spin. Development of the gyrocopter would eventually lead to vertical take off and landings. War time use was mostly for aerial surveillance."

 air_air_missile_1_desc:0 "Advances in guided munition technologies have applications for bomber interception. Adding controllable fins to a rocket and a control wire allows a pilot to manually control the flight path of the rocket, allowing far more accurate fire. Since the pilot must use a joystick to control the rocket, the system isn't very effective against enemy fighters, as the pilot would struggle to do two things at once."

These early munitions were very susceptible to radio jamming." 
 anti_ship_missile_2:0 "Guided propelled anti-ship munition" 
 anti_ship_missile_2_desc:0 "Since rocket technology has become reliable enough to be used in a tactical manner, it seems only logical that adding a rocket motor to our guided munitions would be the next step, allowing further range and higher munition speed. This in turn means that the bombardier is able to better direct the munition, thus allowing for better accuracy."

 night_vision3_desc:0 "Research into Night Vision Devices (NVDs) began in 1929, and the NVD equipment that was used during WWII is now considered Generation 0. Two platoons of Panthers were equipped with the Sperber FG 1250, and the StG-44 with the Vampir ZG 1229. The Soviet Union conducted field tests of the PAU-2 in 1942. The US Army tested the M-1 and M-3 infrared night sighting devices, and in the Korean War this equipment saw limited service assisting snipers."
 infantry_at3_desc:0 "Post war time development of infantry anti-tank weapons focused on two goals. The first is that anti-tank weapons must be able to defeat post war heavy tanks, and second they must be lightweight and portable for infantry."
 infantry_at4_desc:0 "In 1955 the first wire-guided missile, Nord Aviation SS.10, entered service in the French Army. It’s development was inspired by the war time German Ruhrstahl X-4 missile."
 support_weapons5_desc:0 "Post war time development of support weapons focused on improving these weapons. Improvements to the M1919 Browning machine gun included a new cartridge and disintegrating belt links. The weapon was lighter, but still too heavy for combat and thus it was not adopted." 
 support_weapons6_desc:0 "Efforts to improve machine guns continued, and in the West a standard Nato grade cartridge was adopted. The Mk 21 was a US Navy conversion of the M1919A4 that fired the 7.62mm Nato cartridge. The M2HB Browning was required to perforate 22.2mm of armour at 91m with armour-piercing ammunition. Both the German MG 42 and Soviet DShK were modernized. The MG 42 would be redesigned as the MG3. Medium machine guns are now classified as GPMG (general-purpose machine guns)."
 armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "Mobility should be prioritized for new armored car designs. A more powerful engine would best fit this requirement for modern armored cars."
 armored_car_equipment_4_desc:0 "Firepower should be prioritized for new armored car designs. A large caliber weapon mounted in a turret would be best for this requirement for more firepower."
 armored_car_equipment_5_desc:0 "Modern communications should be prioritized for new armored car designs."
 armored_car_at_equipment_1_desc:0 "Large caliber weapons should be prioritized for new armored car variants. These weapons can be mounted in a forward facing direction."

 amphibious_mechanized_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked (LVT), used by the US Marine Corp, was redesigned in 1949 as the LVT-3C. It had an armoured roof and the bow was extended to improve the boyance."
 tech_engineers5_desc:0 "Field engineers facilitate the mobility of friendly forces while impeding enemy mobility. They work to assure the survivability of friendly forces through the use of specialized knowledge and engineering equipment."
 tech_engineers6_desc:0 "Field engineers perform a variety of military tasks that could include mine warfare, bridging and road construction, construction of or breaching trenches and other obstacles, and fighting alongside regular infantry."
 tech_recons5_desc:0 "Reconnaissance is the exploration of an area by military forces to obtain information about enemy forces, terrain, and other activities. It is often called recce by the British military or recon by the American military."
 tech_recons6_desc:0 "Information gathered by field recce can be by area, route, or zone. Area is a specified location, route may be a road, railway, waterway, or narrow axis of advance, and zone is detailed information about the enemy’s location, strengths, and weaknesses."
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "New police forensic techniques need to be developed to help crush any remaining underground resistance."
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "With the help of new electronic technologies we can improve upon our surveillance of occupied territories for new resistance groups."
 tech_maintenance_company5_desc:0 "Priority should be given to developing an apprenticeship program that will provide our maintenance personnel with the skills needed to complete repairs efficiently."
 tech_maintenance_company6_desc:0 "Specialized equipment needs to be developed so that our maintenance personnel can carry out complex maintenance, repairs or overhauls."
 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "The basic structure of a mobile medical unit was established by Major Marran in Patton’s Third Army during WWII. His method of providing medical aid sooner to wounded soldiers was admirade and supported by the command structure. However, it was not until the Korean War that this method of triage was officially adopted by the US military." 
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "During the Korean War the US military established mobile army surgical hospitals for providing medical care to wounded soldiers. MASH units were an improvement over the random individual systems of portable surgical hospitals that were used during WWII. Wounded soldiers are first treated on the line and then sent to a battalion aid station to be stabilized. From there they go to a MASH unit for extensive treatment."
 tech_logistics_comapany5_desc:0 "With advance planning and forecasting techniques we can improve on our distribution of supplies."
 tech_logistics_comapany6_desc:0 "With modern equipment that is designed around logistics needs we can handle a greater amount of supplies."
 tech_signal_company5_desc:0 "Policies and procedures for comms personnel need to be improved upon so that the enemy can not glean any significant information while intercepting our communications."
 tech_signal_company6_desc:0 "With new electronic technologies we can improve upon our encryption methods of battlefield communications."

Even during the war the Sturmgewehr (StG) 44 greatly increased the volume of fire when compared to the standard infantry rifle. After the war the StG 45, a wartime Mauser prototype, had a significant influence on post war weapon designs. The main focus was to design an assault rifle which was to be gas-operated, selective fire, and have a 20-round magazine."

The Italians designed the LF-59, the Japanese designed the Type 64, and the Germans designed the HK33. The USA, Britain, and the Soviet Union’s weapons development were continuous from wartime to peacetime. The US M-14 rifle comes from improvements made to the M1 Garand. The development of M-16 continues with this process and standardization follows for the Nato countries; ie, 7.62 and 5.56 Nato cartridges. The countries behind the Iron Curtain look to the AK-47, and its variants, as their main battle rifles."

 USA_anti_air_equipment_desc:0 "The M45 Quadmount, a.k.a. ‘Krautmower’ for its high rate of fire, consisted of four heavy barrel .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns. The turret was designed by the W.L. Maxson Corporation and it replaced the M33 twin mount. It was electrically powered and designed as an anti-aircraft weapon. However, it was also effective against ground targets."

 USA_anti_air_equipment_5_desc:0 "The M1 120mm is a super-heavy AA gun that was used from 1944 to 1960. Its development began after WWI and the prototype was first assembled in 1924. It was considered too heavy and expensive. The need for a super-heavy AA gun was renewed in 1938 and a new prototype was ready by 1940. A battery of guns consisted of four guns, radar, gun director, gun data computer, and the M6 tractor."
 USA_anti_air_equipment_6:0 "M51 Skysweeper"
 antiair6_desc:0 "Post World War II development of anti-aircraft guns was focused on tracking and directing the AA battery to fire at increasingly faster aircraft. Fire control was improved by the use of  gun directors. Gun directors were used in conjunction with other fire control equipment; such as, height finders and radar."
 anti_air_equipment_5_desc:0 "Fire control for an anti-aircraft battery can be improved with the use of gun data computers. By adding gun data computers to existing radar and gun directors the AA battery will be correctly pointed at enemy aircraft. Azimuth, elevation and fuze time will now be handle by a complex fire control system."
 anti_air_equipment_6_desc:0 "Fire control for an AA battery can further be improved by combining an individual AA gun with gun laying radar, an analog computer (or director), and an autoloader all onto a single carriage."
 anti_air_equipment_7_desc:0 "Modern anti-aircraft gun development has focused on designing AA guns that are of light calibre (20mm to 30mm) and mobile. Jet aircraft flying at low altitudes, usually under 2.5km, are the primary target for these anti-aircraft guns. Aircraft flying above 2.5km are now the priority target for the newly developed surface-to-air (SAM) missiles."

The initial design was mounted on an M2 howitzer carriage and this was ready by Sept 1941. There were minor problems with this combination and a modified gun carriage called the M6 was used. Production began in Dec 1942 and when deployed it was considered too heavy. It was phased out of service in favour of self-propelled tank destroyers."

It can be used in both anti-tank and anti-personnel roles. Development for a recoilless rifle began during WWII with a demonstration of a 57mm recoilless rifle. Larger calibers were recommended, but development was halted in June 1947. The Korean war saw the revival of the project and the extensive use of the M27."

 anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "War-time improvements to AT guns was necessary due to an increased thickness of tank armour. This in time would result in the development of heavier tanks and even better AT guns. By war's end AT guns would be 85mm and larger. The 128mm Pak 44 was Germany's last war-time AT gun."
 #anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Post war-time AT gun development continued with larger and more powerful AT guns. The Soviet Union made improvements to its 85mm gun with the introduction of the D-48 85mm gun, and the US Army continued with its development of AT recoilless rifles."
 #anti_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "Improvements to AT capabilities in a post-war era saw the Soviets introduce a larger AT gun - the T-12 100mm Gun. The US Army continued working on recoilless rifles, and the development resulted in deployment of the M40 Recoilless Rifle (105mm rifle with the M8C .50cal spotting rifle attached)."

There may be light weapons, less than 20mm cannons, that are used for defending the vehicle and crew from enemy attacks, but they do not provide direct fire in support of the battle."
 mechanized_equipment_5_desc:0 "The APC’s that were used during WWII include the American M3 half track, the German Sd. Kfz. 251, and the British Universal Carrier. They evolved from simple armoured cars with transport capacity to purpose built vehicles. The importance of having soldiers accompany tanks into battle became obvious as armies gained the battle field experience that they need in fighting modern wars. Technology was advancing rapidly and this ushered in new weapon systems and tactics."
 #mechanized_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) evolved out of the APC, and it was after WWII that these vehicles were deployed by militaries around the world. The French AMX-VCI (Véhicule de Combat d`Infanterie) incorporates many of the characteristics now associated with a modern IVF.
